          <p class="text"> Time to visit the PET team, which stands for Playback Experience Team. For two weeks, we had the chance to follow the PET team and see what a typical day looks like. Here, they develop the video player used by Play, Children‚Äôs, and News. Unlike many other teams, pair or mob programming isn't the most common approach, instead they mostly code individually ‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è.</p>

            <h3 class="rubrik">Our Learnings</h3>
          <p class="text"> During these weeks, we got to try out a mix of different tasks, with a particular focus on testing. It started with us helping to ensure quality on SVT Play ahead of a release, to make sure everything worked as it should. It was exciting to see how much is actually tested manually, in contrast to a lot of other things that are automated. We also contributed to the ongoing work of automating testing by programming a test ourselves that runs automatically against SVT Play. We got to observe when a new test was rolled out on SVT Play, this time to evaluate clearer speech in programs üì¢. At the same time, we worked on an analysis of how streaming services are structured, with a special focus on user experience and features ahead of the Olympics.</p>

          <p class="text"> After two months in the TV building, there was still a lot left to explore, and Iana from the team took us on a sunny lunch walk to the garden in the back, which we didn‚Äôt even know existed üåû. Even more surprising was that there‚Äôs an old cemetery on the grounds?! We also got great book recommendations from the team, perfect for reading in a sunbed this summer üìö.</p>
