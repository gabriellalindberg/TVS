          <p class="text">The third week was spent with the news team NASA (News And Sports Apps), which develops the SVT Nyheter and SVT Sport apps for Android and iOS. A friendly team that works closely together, primarily through mob programming💻. They also have a strong focus on UX and design, and it’s clear that the user experience is a key part of their development process.</p>

            <h3 class="rubrik">Our Learnings</h3>
          <p class="text">With them, we got to try mob programming for the very first time, something we had never heard of before. It was a bit challenging to take the driver’s seat in the mob for the first time, but it was really fun and a great learning experience! NASA taught us that there’s no such thing as a stupid question and that you should always ask when something’s unclear🤔. That mindset has been incredibly useful throughout our internship because if there’s one thing we’ve done a lot of, it’s asking questions.</p>

          <p class="text">Our week with NASA happened to coincide with Fettisdagen, so of course we had a fika with delicious semlor. We also got to attend our very first workshop ever, which was led by Gitte together with the team. And let’s not forget the joy when Henrik’s dogs made a surprise appearance in a teams-meeting🐕🐾!</p>
